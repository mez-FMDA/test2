| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Description    | Describes the end-to-end process, orchestrated by FMAR, for transferring one or more consumer-owned assets from a Losing FSP to a Gaining FSP, initiated and authorised by the asset owner / consumer's consent.                                      |
| Goal            | To provide a secure, seamless, and consumer-centric digital journey for switching flexibility providers, thereby promoting competition and consumer choice in the market.                                                              |
| Actors         | Consumer (via Consent Solution), Asset Owner, Gaining FSP, Losing FSP, FMAR System, Consumer Consent Solution System.                                                                                                                  |
| Preconditions  | • The asset(s) to be switched are registered in **ARM** and associated with the Losing FSP. <br> • Both FSPs are registered in **SPUM**. <br> • The consumer initiates the switch and provides verifiable consent via the external Consumer Consent solution. |
| *Process Summary | 1. **Consent & Initiation:** Consumer provides explicit consent to switch to the Gaining FSP via the **Consumer Consent Solution**. This solution generates a secure authorisation token/proof. <br> 2. **Request:** The Gaining FSP (or the Consent Solution directly) submits a "Switch Asset" request to FMAR, providing the FMAR Asset ID(s) and the authorisation proof. <br> 3. **Verification:** FMAR's **ARM** validates the authorisation proof by making a real-time call to the **Consumer Consent Solution** (UC-05.05). <br> 4. **Notification & Re-assignment:** Upon successful verification, FMAR notifies the Losing FSP of the pending switch (with a defined notice period). **ARM** updates the FSP link for the asset. If the asset was the sole component of a Market Unit, **PSQM** re-assigns the entire unit (UC-03.02). If it was part of a larger group, the Market Unit composition is updated (UC-03.03). |
| Postconditions  | • The asset(s) are authoritatively associated with the Gaining FSP in **ARM**. <br> • The Losing FSP no longer has commercial control over the asset via FMAR. <br> • All relevant Market Units in **PSQM** are updated. |
| Dependencies    | • Critically dependent on the technical integration with the Consumer Consent solution (UC-10.01). |
| Key Considerations| • This use case describes a specific business journey that *invokes* other technical use cases like UC-03.03 and UC-03.04. <br> • Clear business rules for handling assets that are part of larger aggregated Market Units (SPGs) are essential. |
