| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Description**     | The core function of providing authorised stakeholders with a unified, secure, and standardised view of all FMAR data via a central set of APIs, regardless of where data might be physically stored.                                                          |
| **Goal**            | To enable efficient planning, procurement, market operation, and regulatory oversight by providing a single, trusted point of access to the "Single Source of Truth" for flexibility asset, provider, and qualification data. *This should be designed for interoperability with any anticipated **Flexibility Digital Infrastructure** and remain extensible to support emerging real-time and performance requirements, particularly those expected under future NESO-DSO coordination frameworks operating within the operational timescale.*                                     |
| **Actors**          | System Operator (DSO/NESO), FSP (for their own and relevant public data), Independent Market Platform (IMP), Ofgem, other authorised parties.                                                                                                                |
| **Preconditions**   | • The requesting entity and user are authenticated via SPUM. <br> • The entity is authorised to access the specific data slice being requested. <br> • All necessary consumer consents for the underlying data are in place and verifiable.                    |
| **Process Summary** | 1. An authorised user/system makes a specific API request to the FMAR Hub (e.g., "GET all BESS assets in GSP Group _X," "GET qualification status for Market Unit Y"). <br> 2. The FMAR API layer authenticates the request and validates permissions based on the user's role and entity defined in SPUM. <br> 3. The API layer acts as a gateway, retrieving and combining data from the relevant modules (ARM, PSQM, GICM) as needed to fulfill the request. <br> 4. FMAR returns the data in a standardised, machine-readable format consistent with the FMAR Common Ontology. |
| **Postconditions**  | • The authorised user securely receives the requested data. <br> • All data access is logged for audit purposes.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Dependencies**    | • Critically dependent on a robust and granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) framework defined in SPUM. <br> • Relies on a well-defined interface with the Consumer Consent solution.                                                                 |
| **Key Considerations** | • The API must be designed to be highly performant, secure, and scalable. <br> • In a federated model, this layer is also responsible for orchestrating queries to external DPNs, adding complexity around performance and reliability. |
