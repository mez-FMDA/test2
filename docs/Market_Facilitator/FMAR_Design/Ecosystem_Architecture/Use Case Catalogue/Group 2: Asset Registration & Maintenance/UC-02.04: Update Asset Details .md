**Primary Module:** Asset Registration Module  (supported by SPUM)  

| Element          | Description                                                                                                                            |

| **Description**      | Enables an authorised user to modify the attributes of an already registered asset.                                                   |
| **Goal**             | To maintain the accuracy of the asset "Single Source of Truth" over its lifecycle.                                                     |
| **Actors**           | FSP, Asset Owner, Third-Party platform                                                                                                                      |
| **Preconditions**    | • The asset exists in ARM. <br> • The user is authorised via SPUM to manage the asset.                                                |
| **Process Summary**  | 1. An authorised user submits updated data for a specific asset via the FMAR API, referencing its unique FMAR Asset ID. <br> 2. ARM receives the request and validates the new data for conformance with the asset category's schema. <br> 3. If the FSP is being changed, ARM validates the new FSP's identity against SPUM. <br> 4. Upon validation, the asset record in ARM is updated. The previous version of the data is retained to ensure a full audit history. <br> 5. ARM automatically assesses if the change is "material" (e.g., >X% capacity change) and, if so, publishes an event to notify other modules (like PSQM and GICM) that re-assessment may be required |
| **Postconditions**   | • The asset's record in ARM reflects the latest information. <br> • The update is versioned and auditable (UC-05.06).                            |
| **Dependencies**     | • Changes might trigger a re-assessment in PSQM or GICM.                                                                               |
| **Key Considerations** | • Material changes (e.g., capacity) must trigger notifications to relevant parties. <br> • The process must be efficient to encourage FSPs to keep their portfolio data accurate and up-to-date.                                                   |
