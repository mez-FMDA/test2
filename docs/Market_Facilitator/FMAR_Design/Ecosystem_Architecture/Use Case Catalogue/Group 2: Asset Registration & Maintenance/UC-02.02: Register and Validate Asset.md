**Primary Module:** Asset Registration Module  (supported by SPUM)  


| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Description**     | The primary, end-to-end process for an authorised user to submit data for a new flexible asset, have that data validated for both conformance and authenticity, and be assigned a unique, persistent FMAR ID.                          |
| **Goal**            | To create a single, **trusted and validated**, authoritative record for a flexible asset that can be used across multiple markets, eliminating re-registration and building confidence in the data's integrity from the outset.         |
| **Actors**          | FSP, Asset Owner (acting via FSP or directly), Installer, Independent Market Platform, FMAR System (automated).                                                                                                                     |
| **Preconditions**   | • The registering user and their organisation are registered and authenticated via **SPUM**. <br> • The relevant asset category exists (`UC-02.01`). <br> • Required consumer consent is in place.                                     |
| **Process Summary** | 1. **Submission:** User submits asset data (technical, locational, ownership) via the FMAR API. <br> 2. **Conformance Validation:** **ARM** immediately validates the data against the relevant asset category schema and business rules. If it fails, the request is rejected with clear errors. <br> 3. **Registration & ID Assignment:** If conformance validation passes, **ARM** creates the asset record with a "Pending Validation" status and assigns the unique, persistent FMAR Asset ID, linking it to the FSP in **SPUM**. <br> 4. **Authenticity Validation:** FMAR automatically initiates checks against trusted external sources (e.g., DNO connection data via DSI, OEM registries) based on the submitted data (e.g., MPAN, serial number). <br> 5. **Status Update:** Upon completion of external checks, the asset record in **ARM** is updated with a final validation status (e.g., "Verified," "Query"). |
| **Postconditions**  | • A unique, immutable FMAR Asset ID is created. <br> • The asset is registered in **ARM** with a clear, auditable validation status and is discoverable by authorised parties. |
| **Dependencies**    | • Requires a valid FSP/User identity from **SPUM**. <br> • Relies on the availability of trusted external data sources via DSI for authenticity validation. <br> • Requires an interface with the Consumer Consent solution. |
| **Key Considerations** | • The process must support both single asset registration and bulk uploads. <br> • Clear rules must define what happens if an asset remains in a "Pending Validation" or "Query" state. |
