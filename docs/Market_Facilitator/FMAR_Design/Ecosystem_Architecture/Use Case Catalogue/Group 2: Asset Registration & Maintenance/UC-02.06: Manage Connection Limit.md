| **Description**        | Enables an authorised System Operator to register, update, and disseminate information about flexible or dynamic connection limits associated with a specific flexible asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Goal**               | To provide a single, authoritative source of truth for dynamic operational constraints on an asset, ensuring both FSPs and SOs have a consistent view to inform safe and effective grid operation and market participation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Actors**             | Impacted Distribution Network Operator (DNO), NESO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Preconditions**      | • The asset is registered in ARM and has a unique FMAR Asset ID. <br> • The SO is authenticated via SPUM and authorised to manage connection data for assets in their network area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Process Summary**    | 1. An authorised SO system submits connection limit data (e.g., "non-firm," ANM zone, dynamic export limit of X kW) for a specific FMAR Asset ID via a dedicated FMAR API endpoint. <br> 2. GICM ingests and validates this data. <br> 3. GICM links this constraint data to the corresponding asset record in ARM. <br> 4. The connection limit information becomes part of the shared, authorised view of that asset, accessible via the main Data Sharing use case (UC-05.01). |
| **Postconditions**     | • The asset's record in FMAR reflects its current, authoritative connection limits. <br> • The FSP responsible for the asset can be notified of the update.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Dependencies**       | • Requires a standardised data model/schema for communicating connection limits. <br> • Depends on ARM for the definitive asset record to link the constraint to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Key Considerations** | • This use case is a cornerstone for the GICM module. <br> • The timeliness of these updates is critical; the solution may need to support near real-time updates and an event-driven notification mechanism for FSPs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
Probably we should discuss what input data validation means in this context
