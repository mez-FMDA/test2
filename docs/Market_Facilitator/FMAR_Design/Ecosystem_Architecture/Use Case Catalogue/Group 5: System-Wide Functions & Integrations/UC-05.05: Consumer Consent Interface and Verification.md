# Use Case UC-05.05: Consumer Consent Interface and Verification
**Primary Module:** ARM (Interface)

| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Description**     | Defines the specific, automated interactions between FMAR and the national Consumer Consent solution to manage and verify consumer consent for asset registration and data sharing.                                                    |
| **Goal**            | To ensure all processing of data related to consumer-owned assets within FMAR is legally compliant (e.g., with GDPR), transparent, and builds consumer trust in the flexibility market.                                               |
| **Actors**          | FMAR System, Consumer Consent Solution System, FSP.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Preconditions**   | • A national Consumer Consent solution with a standardised API exists. <br> • The consumer has granted consent for a specific FSP and asset via that solution, generating a unique Consent Reference ID.                                 |
| **Process Summary** | 1. During asset registration (UC-02.02), the FSP provides the Consent Reference ID along with the asset data. <br> 2. ARM makes a real-time API call to the Consumer Consent solution to verify the validity and scope of that consent. <br> 3. If valid, the registration proceeds. <br> 4. The Consumer Consent solution can later send an event-driven notification (webhook) to ARM if the consumer revokes consent. <br> 5. ARM then updates the asset's status to "Suspended - Consent Revoked." |
| **Postconditions**  | • Asset registration and data sharing within FMAR is verifiably linked to active consumer consent. <br> • Consent revocations are automatically actioned within FMAR. |
| **Dependencies**    | • Critically dependent on the existence and technical specification of the external Consumer Consent solution. |
| **Key Considerations** | • This is a vital interface, not a core FMAR function. The API contract between the two systems must be robust and secure. |
