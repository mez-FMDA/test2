**Primary Module:** SPUM

| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Description**     | A specific onboarding process to register and manage the identities and access rights of Independent Market Platforms (IMPs) or other software vendors who will interact with FMAR on behalf of their FSP clients.                              |
| **Goal**            | To securely and efficiently enable the significant portion of the market that will interact with FMAR via third-party software, recognising these platforms as distinct actors with their own technical and security credentials.            |
| **Actors**          | Third-Party Platform Administrator, FMAR Administrator (Elexon).                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Preconditions**   | • The Third-Party Platform is a valid legal entity. |
| **Process Summary** | 1. A platform's representative registers their organization in SPUM, selecting the "Platform" role. <br> 2. They receive a unique Platform ID and secure API credentials, distinct from any FSP. <br> 3. FSPs using this platform can then delegate specific permissions to the Platform ID via SPUM's access control features. <br> 4. The platform can then make API calls to FMAR "on behalf of" its authorised FSP clients. |
| **Postconditions**  | • The Third-Party Platform is a recognized actor in the FMAR ecosystem. <br> • The platform can securely interact with FMAR, subject to the permissions granted by its FSP clients. |
| **Dependencies**    | • Requires an advanced, delegation-based access control model within SPUM. |
| **Key Considerations** | • This is critical for scalability and reflects the reality of the industry structure. <br> • Clear technical and security vetting may be required for platforms to be onboarded. |
