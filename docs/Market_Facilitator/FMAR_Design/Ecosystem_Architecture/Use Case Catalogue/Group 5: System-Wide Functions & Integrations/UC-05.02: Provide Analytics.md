**Primary Module:** All Modules (Reporting Layer)

| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Description**     | Enables authorised bodies to generate aggregated, anonymised reports and analytics from the data held across the FMAR ecosystem.                                                                                                           |
| **Goal**            | To provide high-quality insights into the state and evolution of the GB flexibility market, supporting regulatory oversight, market monitoring, policy development, and strategic decision-making by the Market Facilitator.                 |
| **Actors**          | Ofgem, Elexon (as Market Facilitator), other authorised government or regulatory bodies.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Preconditions**   | • A sufficient volume of data exists across the FMAR modules to generate meaningful analytics. |
| **Process Summary** | 1. An authorised user accesses a dedicated reporting interface or API endpoint with specific permissions. <br> 2. The user runs pre-defined or custom queries (e.g., "growth of BESS assets by GSP group," "number of FSPs qualified for product X," "total registered capacity by technology type"). <br> 3. The FMAR Reporting Layer collates data from ARM, SPUM, and PSQM. <br> 4. The layer applies strict, pre-defined anonymisation and aggregation rules to protect commercial sensitivity. <br> 5. FMAR presents the results in a dashboard, data visualisation, or secure data export. |
| **Postconditions**  | • Stakeholders gain valuable, data-driven insights into the flexibility market. |
| **Dependencies**    | • Critically relies on robust data quality and consistency across all FMAR modules. |
| **Key Considerations** | • A clear, publicly available Data Anonymisation & Aggregation Policy is essential for trust. <br> • In a federated model, this use case likely requires a central data warehouse to avoid performance issues from distributed queries. |
