| **Description**     | Provides a formal, transparent, and auditable process for an authorised party to raise a dispute about the accuracy of data held within FMAR and for the FMAR operator to manage its investigation and resolution.                          |
| **Goal**            | To build and maintain trust in FMAR as the "Single Source of Truth" by ensuring there is a clear and fair process for identifying and correcting data errors.                                                                         |
| **Actors**          | FSP, System Operator, FMAR Administrator (Elexon).                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Preconditions**   | • The data in question exists within an FMAR module. <br> • The disputing party is an authorised user with a legitimate interest in the data.                                                                                          |
| **Process Summary** | 1. A user submits a "Data Dispute" ticket via a dedicated FMAR interface, identifying the specific data record (e.g., FMAR Asset ID), the alleged error, and providing supporting evidence. <br> 2. The FMAR Governance Layer logs the dispute and notifies all relevant parties (e.g., the FSP who registered the data, the SO who provided a qualification status). <br> 3. The FMAR Administrator facilitates the resolution process according to a defined workflow. <br> 4. If a correction is required, the Administrator makes an authorised, auditable update to the relevant module (ARM, PSQM, etc.). |
| **Postconditions**  | • The data dispute is resolved and its outcome (e.g., "Corrected," "No Action Required") is recorded. <br> • If corrected, the relevant FMAR record is updated. |
| **Dependencies**    | • Requires a well-defined and publicly available Dispute Resolution Policy and operational workflow. |
| **Key Considerations** | • Are SLAs for acknowledging and resolving disputes are needed to ensure timeliness? <br> • All steps in the process must be rigorously audited. |
