# FMAR Use Case Catalogue: Complete Summary

This document outlines the core use cases for the Flexibility Market Asset Registration (FMAR) solution.

FMAR supports registration, qualification, and data sharing for flexible assets participating in GB flexibility markets.

It is designed to operate through modular components and may leverage a federated architecture via the Data Sharing Infrastructure (DSI).

### Module Key

- **SPUM** – Service Provider & User Module  
- **ARM** – Asset Registration Module  
- **PSQM** – Product & Service Qualification Module  
- **GICM** – Grid Integration & Constraints Module  
- **API Layer** – Federated data access layer for authorised consumers  
- **Reporting Layer** – Common reporting interface drawing from all modules

**🔶 = Expected to be out of scope for go-live. May be prioritised depending on stakeholder workshop outcomes.**

Out-of-scope modules:
- 🔶 PSQM = Product & Service Qualification Management
- 🔶 GICM = Grid Integration & Constraint Management

You are absolutely right. My apologies for introducing inconsistencies in the grouping names. Consistency is key, and the purpose you've outlined—to show why all modules need to be considered holistically from the start—is a critical message for the design workshops.

Let's stick to the structure you established in your master list and simply provide a clean, updated table that maps the definitive use case names to their delivering modules. This will powerfully illustrate the interconnectedness of the system.

---

Here is the updated table, using your master list's grouping structure and names, to clearly demonstrate how the modules are linked across the entire FMAR vision.

### **FMAR Use Case to Module Mapping**

This table outlines the full scope of defined use cases for the FMAR programme and maps them to the logical data module(s) responsible for their delivery. This illustrates the interconnected nature of the FMAR Hub and supports the need for a holistic design approach, even though capabilities will be delivered in phased releases.

## FMAR Actors

The following table lists the primary actors who interact with the FMAR system across the defined use cases. Actors can be human users or external systems.

| Actor                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                | Key Use Case Interactions                                                                                                     |
| :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flexibility Service Provider (FSP)**     | A commercial entity that aggregates and manages flexible assets to offer services to the market. The primary user of FMAR for managing their portfolio.        | Registering/updating their company, users, and assets. Creating and qualifying Market Units. Accessing their own data.          |
| **System Operator (SO)**                   | Includes Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and the National Energy System Operator (NESO). They operate the grid and procure flexibility services.        | Accessing asset and qualification data for planning and procurement. Recording qualification outcomes. Managing connection limits. |
| **Asset Owner**                            | The legal owner of a flexible asset (e.g., a commercial site or a residential consumer). Typically interacts with FMAR via their chosen FSP.                   | Granting consent (via external solution). Potentially a direct user for viewing their own asset data.                             |
| **FMAR Administrator**                     | Elexon personnel responsible for the administration, governance, and maintenance of the FMAR Hub.                                                              | Maintaining asset categories and the product catalogue. Managing user disputes and system governance.                         |
| **Third-Party Platform**      | Third-party software platforms that provide market access and other services to FSPs. A key system-level actor.                                                | Onboarding as a platform (UC-09.01), then acting on behalf of FSPs to perform various FMAR functions via API.                  |
| **Installer**                              | An entity responsible for the physical installation of flexible assets. May be an early data provider for asset registration.                                  | Potential actor in the initial "Register Asset" use case, providing technical data at the point of installation.                |
| **Ofgem / Regulatory Body**                | The regulator of the GB energy market.                                                                                                                     | Primary consumer of anonymised, aggregated data from the "Provide Analytics" use case for market monitoring and policy making.    |
| **Consumer Consent Solution**              | A critical external system that manages consumer consent. Interacts with FMAR programmatically.                                                              | Provides consent status verification to FMAR and notifies FMAR of consent revocations.                                        |
| **External Data Source**              | An automated system that acts as a trusted source of truth for specific data points used in validation.                                                              | Register and Validate Asset use case depends on this actor. Explicitly naming it reinforces the system's reliance on external integrations for data quality and clarifies that FMAR won't master all data itself                                        |


## Quick Definitions > needs updating

• An 'Asset' (or in the European case a Controllable Unit (CU)) is defined as a single power-generating module and/or demand unit (i.e., an ESA) with a unique relationship to an Accounting Point.

• A Service Providing Unit (SPU) refers to one or more controllable units connected to a single
connection point, as defined by the service provider.

• A Service Providing Group (SPG) is an aggregation of CUs or SPUs connected to more than one
connection point within the same scheduling area, also defined by the service provider
