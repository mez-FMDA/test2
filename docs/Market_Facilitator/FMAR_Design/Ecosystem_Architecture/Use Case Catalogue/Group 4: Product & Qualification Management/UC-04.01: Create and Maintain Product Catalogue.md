| Description        | An administrative function to create and maintain the definitive GB catalogue of all flexibility products, their technical specifications, and standard attributes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Goal               | To provide a single, machine-readable source of truth for all flexibility products, enabling standardisation and simplifying qualification processes for FSPs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Actors             | FMAR Administrator (Elexon), System Operators (contributing product definitions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Preconditions      | • The administrator has the highest level of permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Process Summary    | 1. An SO proposes a new/updated product definition. <br> 2. FMAR Admin, through a governed process, creates or updates the product in PSQM. <br> 3. Admin defines the product's standard attributes (e.g., response time, duration, data requirements), aligning with the FMAR Common Ontology. <br> 4. The product becomes active and available for qualification (UC-03.02). |
| Postconditions     | • The GB Flexibility Product Catalogue in PSQM is updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Dependencies       | • Requires a strong governance process with SOs to manage product definitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Key Considerations | • The process must manage versioning of products and ensure backward compatibility where possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
