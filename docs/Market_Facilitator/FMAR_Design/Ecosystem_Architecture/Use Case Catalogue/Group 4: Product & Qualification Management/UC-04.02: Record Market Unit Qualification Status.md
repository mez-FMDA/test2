| Element          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Description      | Manages the workflow for an FSP to request qualification for a Market Unit against a specific product, and for a System Operator to authoritatively record the outcome of their external assessment process within FMAR.                                                                                                                                    |
| Goal             | To act as the central, trusted "Single Source of Truth" for the qualification status of all Market Units, creating a transparent and standardised record that streamlines procurement for SOs and enables qualification portability.                                                                                                                        |
| Actors           | FSP, System Operator (DSO/NESO).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Preconditions    | • The Market Unit is defined in PSQM. <br> • The relevant flexibility product is defined in the Product Register (UC-04.01).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Process Summary  | 1. FSP submits a qualification application for a Market Unit against a Product via the FMAR API. <br> 2. FMAR registers the application and notifies the relevant SO, providing a standardised data package about the Market Unit (from ARM & PSQM). <br> 3. The SO uses its own external systems and processes to conduct the technical verification and assessment. <br> 4. Upon completion, the SO submits the final outcome (e.g., "Qualified," "Failed," with validity period) back to FMAR via a standardised API. <br> 5. PSQM authoritatively records and timestamps the new qualification status. |
| Postconditions   | • The Market Unit has a verifiable qualification status for a specific product in PSQM, discoverable by authorized parties. <br> • An auditable trail of the status change is created.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Dependencies     | • Requires a standardized process and API for SOs to consume application data from FMAR and to publish qualification outcomes back to FMAR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Key Considerations | • FMAR is the system of record for the status, not the system of assessment. <br> • Clear SLAs are needed for how quickly SOs are expected to process applications and update the status in FMAR.                                                                                                                                            |
I really dont know if supply chain risk needs to be evaluated. but please walk me thoughh this US so I can ask my questions
