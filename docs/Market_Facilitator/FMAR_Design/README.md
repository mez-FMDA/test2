# FMAR Design Artefacts Repository

**Welcome to the official design artefact repository for the Flexibility Market Asset Registration (FMAR) Programme, managed by Elexon as the GB Market Facilitator.**


## Contributing

We actively encourage participation from all industry stakeholders. Your expertise is crucial to our success.

*   **To Review Artefacts:** All published design documentation can be indexed in the table of contents below. We will progressively add more design documentation as we undertake our workshops. We recommend starting with the Programme-Level and Ecosystem-Architecture folders to read the latest understanding of the descriptions of the core user journeys and functionalities FMAR will support.

*   **To Provide Feedback or Raise a Change:** The primary method for providing feedback is by commenting on the appropriate thread in **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mez-FMDA/MF.github.io/discussions/categories/general-discussion)**. This can then be formalised as Change to be raised via a **[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/mez-FMDA/MF.github.io/issues)**. Please use the available templates to ensure your feedback uses the correct structured issue template and can be effectively triaged by our team. If you are unsure whether to provide feedback or raise a change, please refer to our **[Contribution Guidelines and Code of Conduct](https://github.com/elexon-data/Market-Facilitator/blob/main/docs/Market_Facilitator/FMAR_Design/Programme_Level/Miscellaneous/rules-of-engagement.md)**.  

*   **To Track Progress:** You can "Watch" this repository to receive notifications on new Issues, discussions, and artefact updates. Progress on key design themes is also tracked on our **[FMAR Design Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/elexon-data/projects/1)**.

The table of contents below is structured by way of the different architectural domains and artefacts that will be in scope of Elexon's High Level Design consultation in Winter 2025/2026.
